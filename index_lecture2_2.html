			I hypothetically visited London, New York, and Paris on the same day. I bought a lot of souvenirs with my $,€,£ because I make bank. In London I bought a telephone booth and the queen.
			I had to fight for her because some freak swedish lady that was trying to buy the buckingham palace was trying to buy her too.
			In Paris i bought the eiffel tower, and in New York I bought the statue of liberty. Everything was priceless. Long live america. Swedish meatballs in the US are bomb #noteanoshade
